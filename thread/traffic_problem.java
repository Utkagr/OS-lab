// There is an intersection of two perpendicular roads. The traffic can be either up-down or right-left. 
// But both traffics canâ€™t be together. You just have to put traffic light with two signals only (Red and Green). 
// The question is simply to implement a switch to turn on/off traffic on each side. (A simple synchronization problem).
// Answered using semaphores and threads. Wrote code for the same. Interviewer was very happy and convinced from this.
